### 📝 Project Description
Rice is a staple food for over 50% of the global population, playing a crucial role in food security. However, diseases like Leaf Smut, Brown Spot, and Bacterial Leaf Blight can cause up to 70% yield loss, leading to annual financial losses exceeding $5 billion.
🔹 Traditional manual inspection is slow, error-prone, and not scalable.
🔹 AI-powered deep learning models offer a robust, real-time solution for detecting diseases early and optimizing pesticide usage.

This project aims to build a deep learning-based rice disease detection model to assist farmers in early diagnosis and mitigation, ensuring higher crop yield and reduced losses.
