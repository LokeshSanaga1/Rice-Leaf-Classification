    "-  Rice is by far the most important food crop for people in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Although rich and poor people alike eat rice in low-income countries, the poorest people consume relatively little wheat and are therefore deeply affected by the cost and availability of rice.\n",
    "-  Rice is the staple food for over 50% of the world's population, and its production is crucial for food security\n",
    "- In many Asian countries, rice is the fundamental and generally irreplaceable staple, especially of the poor. For the extreme poor in Asia, who live on less than $1.25 a day, rice accounts for nearly half of their food expenditures and a fifth of total household expenditures, on average.\n",
    "-  This group alone annually spends the equivalent of. $62 billion (purchasing power parity) on rice. \n",
    "- But diseases like Leaf Smut, Brown Spot, and Bacterial Leaf Blight cause up to 70% yield loss, leading to \\$5+ billion in annual losses.\n",
    "- Manual inspection is slow, error-prone, and not scalable, To mitigate this AI-powered solutions are essential for real-time, accurate disease detection.\n",
    "- The global rice market is valued at \\$320+ billion, and AI in agriculture is projected to grow from \\$1.1B (2020) to \\$4B (2026), highlighting massive business potential.\n",
    "- Deep learning models (ResNet50, EfficientNet) can automate disease identification, optimize pesticide usage, and increase crop yield.\n",
    "- AI-based solutions can be deployed via mobile apps, edge AI for offline detection, and IoT-enabled smart farming to support farmers globally.\n",
    "- Business opportunities include SaaS subscriptions, AI-powered drones, and predictive analytics, driving sustainable, cost-effective precision agriculture.\n",
    "- Investing in AI-driven rice disease detection ensures food security, maximizes farm productivity, and revolutionizes modern farming.\n",
    "- So We're going to build the AI-driven rice disease detection model to ensure the mitigation of lose for fromeres by using the deployed model to devices for disease diagnosis."
